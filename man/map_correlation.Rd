\title{Calculate the correlation between true and estimated populations}
\usage{
map_correlation(true, est, byyear = FALSE, method = "pearson")
}
\arguments{
\item{true}{Array of true biomass}

\item{est}{Array of estimated biomass, with matching first and second
dimensions}

\item{byyear}{Calculate correlations by year?}

\item{method}{Which correlation coefficient to use; passed to
\code{\link[stats]{cor}}}
}
\value{
Correlation, or vector of correlations by year
}
\description{
Calculates the correlation of true and estimated populations on a regular,
matching grid. It is expected that these are arrays with the first two
dimensions representing space and the third represents time. The
\code{byyear} argument allows for a correlation over the entire result, or
separate correlations for each year.
